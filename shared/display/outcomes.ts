/**
 * RESULTS-panel outcome math shared by the kiosk booth skin and the pocket surfaces
 * (`pocket-app`) histograms.
 *
 * The outcome space is the DISPLAYED qubit count `D` (rows 0..D-1), following
 * each app's wire-trim setting, NOT the active subset. The recognized circuit
 * is always five physical qubits; the wire-trim transform guarantees no gate
 * touches a row >= D, so marginalizing the remaining |0⟩ rows is exact. Bit
 * order: leftmost stack bit = q0 (top wire).
 *
 * This module owns ONLY the pure math + thresholds — the single source of truth
 * for both panels and their parity tests. The two `*Histogram` components keep
 * their own JSX/class prefixes (`bo-` / `pk-`) until SC2 unifies them.
